# Voter Guide

## How to vote

1. Fork the governance repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. Checkout the active proposal branch (e.g. `proposal/001-color-vote`).
4. Run the `gitvote` CLI tool to cast your vote:

`gitvote cast --choice purple`

5. Push your branch to your fork.
6. Open a Pull Request targeting the proposal branch.

Once your PR passes CI, your vote will be counted.
